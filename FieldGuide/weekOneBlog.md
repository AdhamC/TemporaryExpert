# Week 1 update blog
after meeting with: 

* Coach Wayne, the current head of Health and Wellness on campus.
* Rami, a now-part-time counselor on campus who was the head of counseling up until a year ago
* Two nurses, Amat who is a mental health nurse, and Carol who is a physical health nurse

I was able to map out 4 sub-systems of H&W that students have access to. That is where I probably will draw the boundary of my project, to 
the services provided on campus to the students. 
[Here is a map of the 4 subsystems.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cwjw229gCBFSo76q6r71LW_M6HxbeIGE/view?usp=sharing)

If you notice there are little numbers in square brackets all over the map, and that would be supplemental information, since there is no way that I'll
be able to get all the information I've gathered into that map. Here is the map supplement:

1. The reason I’m making a clear distinction between physical and mental health on campus is that we have Medical Doctors (M.Ds) in physical health, while we do not in mental health. We only have counselors, who are not allowed to prescribe medication and do not carry the title of M.D.
2. If counselor is not available, Amat will get a doctor from the physical health section to see the patient. Currently there is only 1 full-time counselor, and 2 part-time counselors. I talked to one of the counselors about why the university is not hiring more counselors since they are very understaffed and overworked. He explained to me how the process of licensing counselors in Abu Dhabi is difficult and why it is difficult. The reason is that in the US, the certify counselors as long as they are safe, no necessarily good. While here, they focus on making sure the counselor is a good one in order to get licensed, since the counselor has an ability to cause serious harm if they did not know what they are doing
3. In my experience, ambulance will arrive in around 20 minutes. 
4. The wellness exchange and nurse advice lines connect you to people in New York. It is important to keep in mind that they might not know everything about Abu Dhabi.
5. I asked both nurses and coach Wayne who is the current director of the H&W center about why the H&W center is not open after hours considering the closest hospital is a 20 minute drive from campus. They had 2 reasons for that:
	1) Staffing
	2) They do not believe there would be a need for it. H&W doesn’t do emergencies to begin with, and their recommendation is to call 999 instantly for those situations even if you are unsure. One of the nurses mentioned that she worked at a 24/7 university clinic before, and the foot traffic during after hours was insanely low.
